# Bump-Bot
A simple bumping bot for automatically bumping Discord servers on Disboard
## Installation
1. Clone the repository as usual (using git or downloading the ZIP)
2. Install the required npm dependencies: electron (IMPORTANT)
_If the command doesn't work, make sure npm is installed on the computer and that npm is initiated in the directory by doing npm install._
3. To run the application, git bash into the directory (or open a terminal and navigate to the directory) and run **npm start .**
_Make sure the console stays open for as long as the program is running!_

Any errors and such for debugging will be available in the console.

This project is currently not maintained, feel free to fork. Any issues that open up will be addressed however.
